# athens-bird-powerlines

Hello! Welcome to the read.me of my Honors Thesis! My goal of this project was to discover impacts on bird populations in managed and unmanaged powerlines in Athens, GA.
I used "tidy" to wrangle the datasheet datasets, ggplot2 to visualize the data in graph form, linear models for statistical analysis, and pca for multivariable analysis
